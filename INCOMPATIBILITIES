This file documents known incompatibilities between Linux and Solaris dtrace,
together with the difficulty of overcoming them, and the likelihood that they
will be overcome.


Tiny variations in behaviour of dtraced processes immediately after startup
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Difficulty: High
Likelihood: Low

Because Linux dtrace depends on ptrace() at attachment time, a very few tiny
behavioural changes can be expected in dtraced processes in the instant
dtrace begins attaching to them.  Notably, a process that has just been
created or grabbed by dtrace may lose signals sent to it and will not be
debuggable until dtrace has set it going.  This problem does not exist
for processes that are already being debugged.

It is highly unlikely that anyone will ever notice this.


Kernel provider names differ
----------------------------
Difficulty: Very high
Likelihood: Nil

Kernel provider names largely differ between Solaris and Linux. This is no
different from other dtrace platforms, for the same reason, and is just as
unlikely to be fixed. The kernels are different, thus the providers are
different.
