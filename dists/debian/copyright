 DTrace Process Control
 .
 This library provides several mechanisms in the libproc control layer:
 .
 Process Control: a control thread is created for each process to provide
 callbacks on process exit, to handle ptrace()-related signal dispatch tasks,
 and to provide a central point that all ptrace()-related requests from the
 rest of DTrace can flow through, working around the limitation that ptrace()
 is per-thread and that libproc makes extensive use of it.
 .
 MT-Safety: due to the above ptrace() limitations, libproc is not MT-Safe or
 even capable of multithreading, so a marshalling and proxying layer is
 provided to route all communication with libproc through the control thread.
 .
 NOTE: MT-Safety is NOT provided for libdtrace itself, or for use of the

 This script tests that -- if a exec(2) fails -- the proc:::exec probe fires,
 followed by the proc:::exec-success probe (in a successful exec(2)).  To
 circumvent any potential shell cleverness, this script generates exec
 failure by generating a file with a bogus interpreter.  (It seems unlikely
 that a shell -- regardless of how clever it claims to be -- would bother to
 validate the interpreter before exec'ing.)

 Test tcp:::state-change and tcp:::{send,receive} by connecting to
 the remote tcp service and sending a test message. This should result
 in a "Protocol mismatch" response and a close of the connection.
 A number of state transition events along with tcp send and receive
 events for the message should result.
 .
 This may fail due to:
 .
 1. A change to the ip stack breaking expected probe behavior,
 which is the reason we are testing.
 2. The remote ssh service is not online.
 3. An unlikely race causes the unlocked global send/receive
 variables to be corrupted.
 .
 This test performs a TCP connection to the ssh service (port 22) and
 checks that at least the following packet counts were traced:
 .
 4 x ip:::send (2 during the TCP handshake, the message, then a FIN)
 4 x tcp:::send (2 during the TCP handshake, the messages, then a FIN)
 3 x ip:::receive (1 during the TCP handshake, the response, then the FIN ACK)
 3 x tcp:::receive (1 during the TCP handshake, the response, then the FIN ACK)
 .
 For this test to work, we are assuming that the TCP handshake and
 TCP close will enter the IP code path and not use tcp fusion.

 DTrace has an intrinsically broken integer model.  Internally, it
 represents all integers in 64-bit registers -- importantly, it assumes
 that integers are represented in 64 bits and do not frequently need
 type casting.  Recent patches have fixed some of the problems, but
 other issues will remain until code generation becomes much more
 diligent about type casting.  This test is an XFAIL placeholder
 illustrating a few problems until these issues are addressed.
 .
 Specifically, when signed integers are represented as 64-bit sign-extended
 values, results of their operations are sometimes improperly represented --
 say, when the uppermost bit flips.  The uppermost bits need to refilled.
 .

 Test tcp:::{send,receive} of IPv4 TCP to a local host.
 .
 This may fail due to:
 .
 1. A change to the tcp stack breaking expected probe behavior,
 which is the reason we are testing.
 2. The lo interface missing or not up.
 3. The local ssh service is not online.
 4. An unlikely race causes the unlocked global send/receive
 variables to be corrupted.
 .
 This test performs a TCP connection and checks that at least the
 following packet counts were traced:
 .
 3 x tcp:::send (2 during the TCP handshake, then a FIN)
 2 x tcp:::receive (1 during the TCP handshake, then the FIN ACK)
 .
 The actual count tested is 5 each way, since we are tracing both
 source and destination events.
 .
 For this test to work, we are assuming that the TCP handshake and
 TCP close will enter the IP code path and not use tcp fusion.

 DTrace Memory Buffer Routines
 .
 The routines in this file are used to create an automatically resizing
 memory buffer that can be written to like a file.  Memory buffers are
 used to construct DOF to ioctl() to dtrace(7D), and provide semantics that
 simplify caller code.  Specifically, any allocation errors result in an
 error code being set inside the buffer which is maintained persistently and
 propagates to another buffer if the buffer in error is concatenated.  These
 semantics permit callers to execute a large series of writes without needing
 to check for errors and then perform a single check before using the buffer.

 Test tcp:::{send,receive} of IPv6 TCP to the local host.
 .
 This may fail due to:
 .
 1. A change to the tcp stack breaking expected probe behavior,
 which is the reason we are testing.
 2. The lo interface missing or not up.
 3. The local ssh service is not online.
 4. An unlikely race causes the unlocked global send/receive
 variables to be corrupted.
 .
 This test performs a TCP connection and checks that at least the
 following packet counts were traced:
 .
 3 x tcp:::send (2 during the TCP handshake, then a FIN)
 2 x tcp:::receive (1 during the TCP handshake, then the FIN ACK)
 .
 The actual count tested is 5 each way, since we are tracing both
 source and destination events.
 .
 For this test to work, we are assuming that the TCP handshake and
 TCP close will enter the IP code path and not use tcp fusion.

 Test ip:::{send,receive} of IPv4 TCP to a remote host.
 .
 This may fail due to:
 .
 1. A change to the ip stack breaking expected probe behavior,
 which is the reason we are testing.
 2. The loopback interface missing or not up.
 3. The local ssh service is not online.
 4. An unlikely race causes the unlocked global send/receive
 variables to be corrupted.
 .
 This test performs a TCP connection and checks that at least the
 following packet counts were traced:
 .
 3 x ip:::send (2 during the TCP handshake, then a FIN)
 2 x ip:::receive (1 during the TCP handshake, then the FIN ACK)
 .
 The network stack may elide at least one of these, so check for 4.

 This script offers no error checking for user input.  The assumption is the
 user will select valid values for the version of the additional tracing
 features and the Ubuntu kernel version.
 Also, the assumption is the user will select a tracing features version
 less than or equal to the Ubuntu kernel version.
