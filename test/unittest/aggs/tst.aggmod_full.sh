#
# ASSERTION:
# We should be able to get the module name (sometimes "vmlinux") for each
# address listed in /proc/kallmodsyms.  Each module should be represented
# by exactly one name.
#
# SECTION: Aggregations/Aggregations
#
##

# Big batches of addresses are tested at once in order to
#   - manage run times
#   - check that each module appears with a single name
# This means that it can be hard to pinpoint which addresses are causing
# problems.
#
# Another diagnosibility problem is that the test suite loads and unloads
# modules (see dtrace-user/test/modules).  So reproducibility of a problem
# changes once the test suite finishes.
#
# To get more precise and useful diagnostic information, set debug=1.
# Run time will increase with the number of errors that need to be isolated.
# So you may have to increase the timeout value to see all errors.
#
# This script will read its own timeout, listed here:
#
# @@timeout: 120
debug=0
#debug=1

dtrace=$1

# progress variables (read the timeout listed above)
# (use "@''@" instead of "@@" so that runtest.sh will not see this line)

timeout=`awk '/^# @''@timeout: [0-9]/ {print $NF}' $0 | head -1`
progress_stop_time=$((`date +%s` + $timeout - 5))
progress_done=0
progress_goal=0

# The temporary directory will be filled with different files:
# - Initially, there will be files named "[$modname]"
#   (including those literal square brackets "[]"),
#   each file contained the addresses corresponding
#   to the module named.
# - Next, these files are replaced by others named "$modname@XXXX"
#   that contain the addresses as parts of D commands.
#   While there is only one "[$modname]" file per module,
#   there can be multiple "$modname@XXXX" files per module
#   to accommodate D program-size limits or, if debug!=0, to
#   improve diagnosibility.  Once a "$modname@XXXX" file has
#   been used, it is deleted.
# - Temporary files like "D.d" and "D.out" come and go.
# The directory will end up empty when all files have been processed.
