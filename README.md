# Linux DTrace

This is the official Linux port of the DTrace tracing tool.

The source is posted here on github.com in the hope that it increases the
visibility for our work and to make it even easier for people to access the
source.  We also use this repository to work with developers in the Linux
community.

The main development branch is [dev](https://github.com/oracle/dtrace-utils/tree/dev).

A small number of kernel patches are needed, which are [here](https://github.com/oracle/dtrace-linux-kernel).
Branches named starting v2/* are suitable (see 2.1.3 below for more details).

We provide prebuilt x86_64 and aarch64 DTrace userspace packages for Oracle
Linux 9 (UEK7 kernel), Oracle Linux 8 (UEK7 or UEK6 kernel), and Oracle Linux 7
(UEK6 kernel).  These packages are based on the Oracle Linux specific release
branch [2.0-branch](https://github.com/oracle/dtrace-utils/tree/2.0-branch).

The latest packages can be obtained from the following
[Oracle Linux yum server](https://yum.oracle.com) repositories: 
- Oracle Linux 9 (x86_64) UEK Release 7: https://yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL9/UEKR7/x86_64/

## How to Build DTrace

The build instructions focus on building DTrace for the upstream Linux kernel.
We will use the 5.14.9 release, but the instructions apply to most recent Linux
kernel versions.

### Prerequisites

Please read this section carefully before moving over to the build
documentation to ensure your environment is properly configured.

#### Step 1: Either install a recent-enough binutils and GCC...

DTrace uses a type introspection system called CTF.  This is supported by
upstream GCC and GNU Binutils.  Make sure you have binutils 2.36 or later
installed, and trunk GCC or GCC 12 (which can be configured with a --prefix
specific to itself to avoid disturbing the system compiler: just point
HOSTCC and CC at that GCC when compiling the kernel and DTrace).

If your distro provides a binutils development package, you need to install
that too (we need to link against libctf.so).

#### Step 2: ... or install the Compact Type Format (CTF) libraries (deprecated)

If you can't update your toolchain, you can alternatively install
[libdtrace-ctf](https://github.com/oracle/libdtrace-ctf).  However, this library
is deprecated and cannot always read CTF produced by the GCC/binutils combination
above.

If you're building a kernel newer than 5.16, you must use the toolchain combination,
as the old libdtrace-ctf-using CTF converter in the kernel tree has been removed
in favour of something much smaller using Binutils's libctf.  Equally, if you're
compiling the kernel using GCC 11 or higher, you must use the toolchain approach
(which means installing GCC master or GCC 12), since the old converter cannot
handle the DWARF emitted by GCC 11.

If you're using libdtrace-ctf, the kernel build additionally depends on the
following packages that may not be installed on the system yet.  The table below
gives the package names for Debian and Oracle Linux as examples.

| Prerequisite | Debian           | Oracle Linux          |
|:-------------|:-----------------|:----------------------|
| glib2        | libglib2.0-dev   | glib2-devel           |
| libdw        | libdw-dev        | elfutils-devel        |
| libelf       | libelf-dev       | elfutils-libelf-devel |

#### Step 3: Build a kernel with add-on features that DTrace uses

DTrace currently depends on a few extra kernel features that are not available
in the upstream kernel:

- CTF type information extraction
- /proc/kallmodsyms
- New system call: waitfd()

As noted above, patches that implement these features are available from the
v2/* branches in our Linux kernel repository for features that DTrace uses:
https://github.com/oracle/dtrace-linux-kernel

The customary way to obtain these patches is to clone an appropriate upstream
kernel version (5.8.1 or later) and to merge our
[updated tree](https://github.com/oracle/dtrace-linux-kernel/v2/5.8.1) into it.
The patch set is quite small, but may need some tweaking if it is being merged
into a newer tree.  We occasionally push a new patched tree to our github repo,
so do look around to see if there is a better match.

Oracle Linux's [UEK7](https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/tree/uek7/ga)
provides a simple alternative if you don't want to patch your own kernel.

Building of a patched kernel from sources is also straightforward.
Please consult `Documentation/process/changes.rst` in the kernel source tree
to ensure all required dependencies are installed first.  The following steps
should build and install the kernel.

```
# Start with your preferred .config options.  Features DTrace needs should
# enable themselves automatically.
make olddefconfig
make

# This step will produce vmlinux.ctfa, which holds all CTF data for the kernel
# and its modules.  If it doesn't work, you don't have a suitable toolchain
# and/or are missing dependencies needed for the older libdtrace-ctf-based
# tools.
make ctf

# Install with root privileges.
sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install
sudo make install
```

It is preferred (but not required) to reboot into your new kernel before
trying to build DTrace.  (If you don't reboot into it, you need to specify
some extra options when running make.)

#### Step 4: Get the Other Necessary Packages

A few remaining packages are required either for building or at runtime.  They
should be part of most Linux distributions today and can be installed via the
package manager of your distro.  The table below gives package names for Debian
and Oracle Linux.

We assume that the packages needed to build the kernel remain installed so they
are not repeated here.

For building:

| Prerequisite       | Debian                      | Oracle Linux              |
|:-------------------|:----------------------------|:--------------------------|
| glibc headers      | libc6-dev                   | glibc-headers             |
| glibc (static)     | (in libc6-dev)              | glibc-static              |
| glibc (32-bit dev) | libc6-dev-i386              | glibc-devel.i686          |
| bison              | bison                       | bison                     |
| flex               | flex                        | flex                      |
| BPF gcc            | gcc-bpf                     | gcc-bpf-unknown-none      |
| BPF binutils       | binutils-bpf                | binutils-bpf-unknown-none |
| libpcap dev        | libpcap-dev                 | libpcap-devel             |
| wireshark          | wireshark                   | wireshark                 |
| valgrind           | valgrind                    | valgrind-devel            |
| fuse3 or fuse      | libfuse3-dev or libfuse-dev | fuse3-devel or fuse-devel |

At runtime:

| Prerequisite       | Debian                 | Oracle Linux              |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------|
| wireshark          | wireshark              | wireshark                 |
| fuse3 or fuse      | libfuse3-3 or libfuse2 | fuse3-devel or fuse-devel |

### Build DTrace

The simplest way of building DTrace is booting into your new kernel with the
add-on features DTrace expects and issuing the following commands from the
DTrace source tree:

```
make
sudo make install
```

Some distributions install the BPF gcc and binutils under different names.  You
can specify the executables to use using the **BPFC** and **BPFLD** variables.
E.g. on Debian you would use:

```
make BPFC=bpf-gcc BPFLD=bpf-ld
sudo make install
```

In this scenario the build system expects that kernel sources can be found at
`/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build`.  It is also expected that the kernel used for
userspace build is compatible with the utils (the exported userspace headers in
the `include/uapi/linux/dtrace` are compatible with the utils version being
built).

You can point at a different kernel version with the KERNELS variable, e.g.
make KERNELS="5.16.8"
as long as the source tree that kernel was built with remains where it was
when that kernel was installed.

See the GNUmakefile for more options (building translators against multiple
different kernels at once, building against kernel sources found in
different places, building against a kernel built with O=, etc.)

'make help' might also be of interest.

## Testing

A testsuite is provided in the source tree.  It is run using **make** in
conjunction with one of the following targets:

|          target           | description                                                           |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `check-verbose`           | Tests binaries from build directory. Prints result of every tests.    |
| `check-installed-verbose` | Tests binaries installed in the system. Prints result of every tests. |

Example:
```
sudo make check-verbose
```

Logs from test runs are stored in `test/log/<run_number>/`.
The most recent logs are also available by via the `test/log/current/` symbolic link.

The testsuite itself has more dependencies that need to be installed.
The full list is available in the [dtrace.spec](dtrace.spec) file.

## How to run DTrace

The `dtrace` binary is installed in /usr/**sbin**/dtrace.
Currently, you can only run dtrace with root privileges.
Be careful not to confuse the utility with **SystemTap's dtrace** script,
which is installed in /usr/**bin**/dtrace.
